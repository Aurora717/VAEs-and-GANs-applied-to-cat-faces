    "#### Encoder network\n",
    "This defines the approximate posterior distribution, which takes as input an observation and outputs a set of parameters for specifying the conditional distribution of the latent representation. In this example, we simply model the distribution as a diagonal Gaussian, and the network outputs the mean and log-variance parameters of a factorized Gaussian. We output log-variance instead of the variance directly for numerical stability.\n",

    "To generate a sample  for the decoder during training, we can sample from the latent distribution defined by the parameters outputted by the encoder, given an input observation $z$. However, this sampling operation creates a bottleneck because backpropagation cannot flow through a random node.\n",

    "\n",
    "where $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$  represent the mean and standard deviation of a Gaussian distribution respectively. They can be derived from the decoder output. The  can be thought of as a random noise used to maintain stochasticity of $z$. We generate  from a standard normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The latent variable  is now generated by a function of $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ which would enable the model to backpropagate gradients in the encoder through $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ respectively, while maintaining stochasticity through $\\epsilon$.\n",
